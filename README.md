## Data Source

Practice Data from InternPulse

## Tools and Methodology

**Tool Used:** EXCEL, Pivot table, Power Query, Excel Functions, Charts
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** I used Power Query to merge the Order, Customers, and Products tables to form a unified table to aid my analysis. I calculated the ‘Total Sales’ Column by multiplying the Unit price by the quantity sold.
**Data Analysis and Insight Finding:** I used A Pivot table to analyze and summarize my data to derive the necessary insights.

**Data Visualization** I created an interactive dashboard containing relevant charts and graphs to present my data properly in a visually appealing manner.

## Key Insights
- Total sales amounted to approximately $45,134, with a total profit of $1,301. The average unit price across products was around $12.91.
- Exc Coffee generated the highest overall sales, despite Ara having the highest quantity sold.
- Light roast coffee was the most popular choice, contributing to $17,354 in sales.
- The United States was the top-performing market, generating $35,638 in sales.
- Loyalty program members contributed significantly to overall sales.
- Peak sales occurred in June.
- 521 customers without a loyalty card generated $24,216.41 in total sales.
- 479 customers with a loyalty card generated $20,917.85 in total sales

## Recommendation
**1. ENHANCE THE LOYALTY PROGRAM TO BOOST RETENTION AND SALES:**
Although there are more non-loyalty card customers (521 vs. 479), loyalty cardholders contribute a significant portion of sales, which suggests that loyalty cardholders may be making frequent  purchases or buying higher-value items. This highlights the importance of a loyalty program in driving consistent revenue.
- **Increase benefits** for loyalty cardholders to incentivize more customers to join. This could include exclusive discounts, special promotions, or bonus points for frequent purchases.
- Introduce **tiered loyalty levels** (e.g., Silver, Gold, Platinum) that offer increasing rewards based on spending or number of visits. This can motivate cardholders to spend more to reach higher tiers.

**2. BOOSTING SALES IN LOW-PERFORMING COUNTRIES:** 
Increasing marketing in Countries like the United Kingdom and Ireland where sales are lower could help attract new customers and raise brand awareness through perhaps localized promotions, 
partnerships, or campaigns that resonate with the demographic in that area.

**3. TARGETED MARKETING FOR BEST-SELLING PRODUCTS:** 
Since Exc generated the highest sales while Ara had the highest quantity sold, consider running targeted marketing campaigns for both products. Highlight Exc for its overall sales success and 
Ara for its popularity among customers.

**4. CROSS-SELLING OPPORTUNITIES:** 
Promote complementary products alongside best-sellers. For example, suggest pairings with light roast coffee, like pastries or specific merchandise, to increase the average order value.

**5. CUSTOMER FEEDBACK LOOP:** 
Establish a feedback mechanism to understand the reasons behind customer preferences, especially regarding the popularity of light roast coffee. This can guide future product development and 
marketing strategies.

**6. IMPROVING OVERALL MARKETING STRATEGY:**
Leverage Digital Marketing:** Use social media, email marketing, and online advertising to reach a wider audience.
- **Partner with Local Businesses:** Collaborate with local businesses for cross-promotions and joint events.
- **Offer Value-Added Services:** Consider offering additional services like coffee bean 
subscriptions or personalized coffee blends
